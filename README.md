# Resolve Dependency - Projects Order to Run

Consider a build system that is to build a set of projects. Projects may be dependent on each other, so they need to be built in order. The inputs will be:

-> List of projects, supplied as a list of strings: A1â€¦An

-> List of dependencies, supplied as pairs: A1 depends on A2 and A3, etc.

Output: Any one valid build order of the projects.

### Examples

Input:
```
P1, P2, P3, P4
(P1, P2), (P1, P3), (P3, P4)
```

Output:
```
P2 P4 P3 P1
```

Input:
```
P1, P2, P3, P4
(P1, P2), (P2, P3), (P3, P4), (P4, P1)
```

We cannot run these projects in any order because we have a deadlock situation.

### Testcases

Input:
```
P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7
(P1, P2), (P3, P2), (P4, P2)
```

Output:
```
P2 P7 P4 P3 P1 P6 P5
```

Input:
```
P1, P2, P3, P4, (P1, P2), (P2, P3), (P3, P4)
```

Output:
Exception - Invalid Input Format
